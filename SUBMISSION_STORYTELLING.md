## Introduction: Building Trust in Forecasting

Hi, I'm Edgadafi, a solo founder from LATAM building the next generation of prediction markets. My mission is simple: make every bet transparent, every payout instant, and every market accessible to anyone with a wallet.

For the past few weeks, I've been deep in the Solana ecosystem, building **PrismaFi** - a fully transparent prediction market platform where you can actually verify what you're betting on. No hidden odds, no delayed payouts, no gatekeepers. Just pure, verifiable markets running on Solana's lightning-fast blockchain.

This is my submission for the Pharos Hackathon 2025 Builders Track, and I'm excited to show you what I've built.

## The Problem: Opacity in Prediction Markets

Traditional prediction markets are broken in three fundamental ways:

### 1. **Opacity & Trust Issues**

When you bet on Polymarket or traditional bookmakers, you're trusting:
- That the odds aren't manipulated
- That the house isn't taking hidden cuts
- That your winnings will actually arrive
- That the resolution will be fair

**You can't verify any of this.** The odds are in a database. The settlement happens behind closed doors. You're betting blind.

### 2. **High Costs & Slow Settlements**

Traditional prediction markets suffer from:
- **Ethereum gas fees**: $5-50 per transaction (kills small bets)
- **Settlement delays**: Days or weeks to claim winnings
- **Withdrawal friction**: Multiple steps, KYC requirements
- **Custody risk**: Your funds sit in someone else's wallet

This makes prediction markets inaccessible to most people. Why would I bet $10 and pay $15 in gas fees?

### 3. **Centralized Control & Censorship**

Most prediction markets are:
- **Permissioned**: Need approval to create markets
- **Geofenced**: Blocked in many countries
- **Custodial**: Platform holds your funds
- **Censorable**: Markets can be shut down arbitrarily

This creates information asymmetry and prevents markets from being true sources of collective intelligence.

## The Solution: PrismaFi

**PrismaFi changes everything by making prediction markets transparent, fast, and permissionless.**

### Core Principles

1. **Transparency First**: Every bet, resolution, and payout is verifiable on-chain
2. **User Sovereignty**: You hold your keys, you own your positions
3. **Instant Finality**: Solana's speed means <1 second settlements
4. **Zero Gatekeepers**: Anyone can create any market
5. **AI-Enhanced**: Multi-agent analysis helps you make better decisions

### 🤖 **AI Market Analyzer** (Powered by Swarms)

This is where PrismaFi gets really interesting. We've integrated **Swarms multi-agent AI orchestration** to give you insights no other prediction market offers:

**Three Specialized AI Agents Working Together:**

1. **SentimentAgent**
   - Scrapes Twitter, Reddit, Discord for market-related discussions
   - Analyzes community sentiment (-1 to +1 score)
   - Identifies trending topics and keywords
   - Measures social volume and engagement

2. **DataAgent**
   - Queries historical blockchain data
   - Identifies similar past markets and their outcomes
   - Calculates average win rates for comparable scenarios
   - Detects price movement patterns (bullish/bearish/neutral)

3. **StrategyAgent**
   - Combines sentiment + historical data into actionable strategy
   - Recommends YES/NO/NEUTRAL position
   - Suggests optimal bet size (% of portfolio)
   - Provides confidence level and risk assessment
   - Explains reasoning in plain language

**What You Get:**
- Confidence score (0-100%)
- Recommended position and size
- Risk assessment
- Multiple reasoning points
- Live updates as market evolves

**This isn't some generic ChatGPT wrapper.** We're using Swarms' multi-agent orchestration to coordinate specialized agents, each with its own data sources and decision logic. The result is analysis that actually helps you make better bets.

### ⚡ **Real-Time Everything**

Every page auto-refreshes:
- Markets page: 10s intervals
- Market detail: 5s (fastest, most critical)
- Dashboard: 8s
- Leaderboard: 15s
- Activity feed: 6s
- Profile pages: 12s

Manual refresh and pause/resume controls on every page. No stale data, ever.

### **Smart Contract Design**

Built with **Anchor 0.30** (Rust), the contract has 5 core instructions:

1. **initialize()** - Set up global state (one-time)
2. **create_market()** - Spin up new prediction market
3. **place_bet()** - User places YES/NO bet
4. **resolve_market()** - Creator declares winner
5. **claim_winnings()** - Winners withdraw proportional payout

**Account Structure:**
- **GlobalState**: Singleton tracking all markets
- **Market**: Per-market data (question, pools, resolution)
- **Bet**: Per-user-per-market position

**Program Derived Addresses (PDAs):**
All accounts use deterministic PDAs for:
- Gas efficiency (no rent, smaller transactions)
- Security (program owns accounts)
- Easy lookups (no database needed)

### **Frontend Architecture**

**Next.js 14 App Router** with:
- Server-side rendering for SEO and initial load speed
- Client-side hydration for interactivity
- Dynamic imports for code splitting
- Edge deployment on Vercel

**Custom Hooks:**
- `useRealTimeData` - Polling + state management + manual controls
- `useAnchorWallet` - Solana wallet integration

**Components:**
- Minimalist-brutalist design (black borders, clear hierarchy)
- Real-time status indicators on every page
- Responsive grid layouts
- Accessible keyboard navigation

1. `connection.getProgramAccounts()` - Fetch all accounts
2. Decode account data using IDL schema
3. Transform to UI-friendly format
4. Update React state
5. Component re-renders

**Writing Data (UI → Blockchain):**
1. User clicks button (e.g., "Place Bet")
2. Build transaction instruction with proper accounts
3. Send via wallet adapter
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Refresh UI data

**AI Analysis (Market → Insights):**
1. User views market detail page
2. `MarketAnalyzer` component mounts
3. Calls `analyzeMarket()` with market data
4. Swarms agents run in parallel
5. Aggregated insights returned
6. UI displays recommendations

## Why Solana?

I chose Solana for five critical reasons:

1. **Speed**: 400ms block times = instant settlements
2. **Cost**: $0.00025 per transaction vs $5-50 on Ethereum
3. **Scalability**: 65,000 TPS theoretical capacity
4. **Developer Experience**: Anchor framework is incredible
5. **Ecosystem**: Growing DeFi + NFT + payments infrastructure

For prediction markets specifically, Solana is perfect because:
- Users place many small bets (fees matter)
- Markets need real-time updates (speed matters)
- Claiming winnings should be instant (UX matters)

## Market Opportunity: Why This Matters

Prediction markets are a **$5B+ global industry** and growing fast:

But **all of them have problems:**
- Polymarket: Polygon (slower than Solana), no AI insights
- Kalshi: Permissioned, US-only, no crypto
- Augur: Dead project, Ethereum gas killed it
- PredictIt: $850 bet limit, academic research license

**PrismaFi's opportunity:**
- Faster than Polygon (Polymarket)

## Conclusion

**PrismaFi isn't just another prediction market.**

It's a bet on transparency, on the power of collective intelligence, and on Solana as the infrastructure for the next generation of financial applications.

Traditional prediction markets hide the truth behind centralized databases and opaque odds. PrismaFi brings everything into the light - every bet, every resolution, every payout is verifiable on-chain.

And with **Swarms multi-agent AI integration**, we're not just transparent - we're intelligent. Our AI doesn't make the decision for you, but it gives you the insights to make better decisions yourself.

This is what prediction markets should be: fast, fair, and accessible to everyone.

**Thank you for reading my submission. Let's make forecasting transparent together.**
